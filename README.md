A repository for miscellaneous tools and utilities. 

## dirgrab

A utility written in Python to grab all directories containing a search
string. This was written because the log folders needed for debugging a
product I work on are often buried a few levels deep in a directory 
tree and I can never remember the few different places where the files
reside.

## calendar

A couple utilities used for converting an outlook calendar into something 
importable into google calendar. ical_backup is a fragile way of exporting
an ics file from Outlook (but, hey, it works...). ical_fix fixes recurring
events that show up blank when they're imported into Google Calendar.
